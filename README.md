# Convolutional Water Tanker Detection

## Overview
Convolutional Water Tanker Detection is a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project that aims to detect water tankers in images using different techniques: template matching, correlation, and convolution. The project provides three different approaches to accurately identify and locate water tankers in an image.

## Project Details
The project utilizes various image processing and DSP techniques to detect water tankers. Three distinct methods are employed:
1. **Template Matching**: This technique involves using OpenCV's `matchTemplate` function to find similarities between a water tanker template image and the main image, enabling the detection of water tankers.
2. **Correlation**: Correlation-based methods are utilized to measure the similarity between a given image patch and the water tanker template. This approach involves computing the cross-correlation or normalized cross-correlation.
3. **Convolution**: The project leverages convolutional operations to detect water tankers. Convolutional filters are applied to the image, enabling the identification of specific patterns associated with water tankers.

## Key Features
1. **Multiple Detection Methods**: The project offers three distinct techniques, allowing users to choose the most suitable approach for their specific requirements.
2. **Customization and Flexibility**: The codebase is designed to be flexible, enabling users to adjust parameters, select different templates, and fine-tune the algorithms to achieve optimal results.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: The project provides metrics to evaluate the performance of each detection method, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Example Code and Usage**: Detailed instructions and example code snippets are provided to assist users in utilizing the different detection methods effectively.
5. **Compatibility and Extensibility**: The project is implemented using popular libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy, ensuring compatibility with various platforms and allowing for easy extension and integration with existing projects.

## Dataset
To evaluate and test the detection methods, a dataset of water tanker images is required. While we do not provide a specific dataset with this project, we recommend using publicly available datasets or creating your own dataset with annotated water tanker images.
